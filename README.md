This Sketch for Arduino Nano/Uno is made for controlling LED Stripes via Bluetooth.

**For thisexample I used:**
- HC-05 (Bluetooth module)
- Arduino Uno (Microcontroller)
- SK6812 (RGBW LED Stripe)

If you don't know how to send the commands, you can checkout [my android app](https://github.com/kappxl/Blueled).
