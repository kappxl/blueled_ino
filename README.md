This Sketch for Arduino Nano/Uno is made for controlling LED Stripes via Bluetooth.

**For thisexample I used:**
- HC-05 (Bluetooth module)
- Arduino Uno (Microcontroller)
- SK6812 (RGBW LED Stripe)

### Notes

The actual code is designed for backlighting arranged as a circle with 30 LEDs. But of course it's fully customizable.
